This implements a basic filesystem in C, the disk is being emulated by a file
and the API for the disk has been written using the conventional file system
and the "emufs" is just an another layer of abstaraction which is using the 
created disk API to act like a file system.

The functionality includes:
open
read
write
seek
truncate

to run it, write the program using the emufs API and compile it with
emufs_general, the read and writes do not neccessarily happening at the block boundary
Some of the header file defines various parameter of the system being emulated
